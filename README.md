# A Day In The Life

This blog is going to be my first personal blog in order for me to express my daily lessons that I learn throughout my time and life. I am learning how to be a better web developer and software developer, with aspirations of becoming a full-stack developer utilizing a variety of web stacks and technology. 

## Goals

My goal is to learn how to better deploy my websites and web applications. I am planning to releasing a blog post on a daily basis to keep a record of my daily progress as I learn to develop by developing. 

### Documentation 
Learning how to use and utilize Markdown in my writing of documentation and blog posts. As the template I'm using for this blog is somewhat limited to how I develop each blog post. As I learn to conform to the template being used I am going to take the challenge to learn how to edit the template as I utilize it. 

### Implemetation 

I will be utilizing Github Pages, as my means for hosting the blog and will be learning new techniques such as Github Actions to create a automated workflow as much as possible.
