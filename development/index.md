Learning everyday how to become a better developer. Through learning various
development techniques and their many different implementations. The
technologies that comprise this site is Jekyll which is a static site generator
that is based on Ruby on Rails.

This is one of many that will be used to further demonstrate my prowess on
implementing, Jekyll in my builds.

## A blog created to help fellow developers

This blog is to be a library, reference and source of information
related to the field of Web Development, Design, Architecture, and much more.
These are my daily catalogs of information that I gained over the years,
from constantly practicing and learning new skills.

These skills I will be sharing with all of you.
