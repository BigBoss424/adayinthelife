      <h1 id="launching-for-reals">Launching, For Reals</h1>

<p>I am launching this blog on Github, really this time. Before I didn’t have a complete understanding of how to utilize Github as a hosting service, as I find it much easier than having to host a server for the blog itself. That way I can mitigate the cost of hosting to a free service until I have a real serious need to move it towards a virtual machine hosted elsewhere.</p>

<h2 id="learning-github-and-utilizing-github-pages">Learning Github and Utilizing Github Pages</h2>

<p>I am taking it upon myself to learn how to utilize the Github platform more often as I develop my own personal network of network and blogs to categorize each of my daily hobbies. I plan on learning how to publish and utilize Github Actions as well. I want to better automate my workflow, since my means of building this site derives from utilizing Jekyll. I will be learning RoR (Ruby on Rails) as a means to edit and customize this site further.</p>

<h3 id="github-actions">Github Actions</h3>
<p>From what I learned from the brief overview of Github Actions, is that I can create a workflow that is completely automated. The problem being is that I haven’t learned enough to understand the automation process from even the examples. The only one that I know works is when I publish a site to as a Github Page. I will be needing to learn JSON and familiarize myself with JavaScript so I can better understand the concepts behind Github Actions. That way I can gain a better scope of the technology better.</p>
