I"É<p>This is a sudden and unexpected turn of events. As it stands, my Lenovo ideaPad L340, has taken a snow dive as the charging port is cracked and the laptop is no longer able to charge. To make do with the current circumstance, I will have to adjust by commonderring my old ASUS G75-JW. The screen is cracked so, I will be placing my NVMe SSD and my old SSD into it. As the Lenovo laptop has the ability to do both drives it did not come with a spare caddy and sata cable. This way I can still be somewhat functional. Thankfully, I was able to obtain my keyboard and begin utilizing it toward this build. With keyboard and monitor, I will be online soon enough and will be updating all my repositories soon.</p>
