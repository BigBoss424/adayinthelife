I"ì<p>As I write this post, a day will have also passed. With that stated, I will be updating my current setup back to my previous laptop, the Dell Latitude e6725. This laptop should be put in a museum, after all the brutal slaughter it took from my abuse of it. I literally have had this laptop ran over by a car and it still works. The only thing that doesnâ€™t work is the LCD Display, which I find to be a shocker in my opinion. Unfortunately with my trails and errors with the ASUS G75-JW, the computer proving more difficult to fix than it was feasible to use. This has peaked my interest in researching about the possible implementation and usage of a SBC (Single-Board Computer). An example of this would be the Raspberry Pi 4 and others.</p>
