I"<p>This is a sudden and unexpected turn of events. As it stands, my Lenovo ideaPad L340, has taken a snow dive as the charging port is cracked and the laptop is no longer able to charge. To make do with the current circumstance, I will have to adjust by commonderring my old ASUS G75-JW. The screen is cracked so, I will be placing my NVMe SSD and my old SSD into it. As the Lenovo laptop has the ability to do both drives it did not come with a spare caddy and sata cable. This way I can still be somewhat functional. Thankfully, I was able to obtain my keyboard and begin utilizing it toward this build. With keyboard and monitor, I will be online soon enough and will be updating all my repositories soon.</p>

<p>I will also be able to stream again as well. My only concern is that of the warranty of the Lenovo ideaPad. I hope that the warranty covers the necessary repairs needed for my machine. Though I wonâ€™t hold my breathe, as I do remember the warranty being the basic one. If the later proves to be true, I will then have an entire week or so until I can purchase a warranty plan that will cover the damages. I will be also looking into repairing and replacing the damaged charging port as another endeavor if all fails. I would hate to have to resort to this last option, I would need to purchase a soldering iron and solder to repair and replace the port. As well as looking for a replacement port for sale. From what I have gathered, it will prove very difficult to go about it by replacing the port itself on my own.</p>
